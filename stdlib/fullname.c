/* Return the canonical absolute name of file NAME.  A canonical name
   does not contain any `.', `..' components nor any repeated path
   separators ('/') or symlinks.  All path components must exist.  If
   RESOLVED is null, the result is malloc'd; otherwise, if the
   canonical name is PATH_MAX chars or more, returns null with `errno'
   set to ENAMETOOLONG; if the name fits in fewer than PATH_MAX chars,
   returns the name in RESOLVED.  If the name cannot be resolved and
   RESOLVED is non-NULL, it contains the path of the first component
   that cannot be resolved.  If the path can be resolved, RESOLVED
   holds the same value as the value returned.  */
